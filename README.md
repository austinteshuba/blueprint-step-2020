**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

## Welcome to Blueprint
Blueprint is a centralized dashboard which introduces cross-features between our favorite Google products: Gmail, Tasks,
and Calendar. These features are designed to enhance power usersâ€™ ability to plan and work effectively. 

### Key Goals and Non-goals
Blueprint synthesizes information from Gmail, Tasks, and Calendar to present useful/actionable highlights
and encourage actions between them, such as automatically creating tasks or calendar events out of emails,
automatically scheduling calendar events from tasks and finding the most efficient order of travel between different
tasks. These features, ultimately, will empower the user to easily plan how they will take action.

We are NOT aiming to simply embed multiple Google products onto a single page. 
Rather, we are aiming to present summary information from each service 
(i.e. You have 35 unread emails in the last 7 days vs. presenting a list of all unread emails 
[which would be redundant])

We are NOT aiming to teach users who do not already use these features on a regular basis since this is targeted towards
power users.

We are NOT aiming to rewrite any existing functionality such as writing our own function to send an email, 
creating our own Google Tasks, or making our own calendar.

We are NOT aiming to store any user information that might be displayed on our dashboard - 
we are simply extracting useful details from the information to digest and display back to the user.
However, this could turn out to be a stretch goal if we wish to cache information to handle large amounts of data.
